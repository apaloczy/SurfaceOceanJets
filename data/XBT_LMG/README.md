-------

The XBT data files from the AR22 line deployed from the ARSV Laurence M. Gould should be placed in this directory.

To convert the XBT files in the original ASCII format (downloaded from [https://www-hrx.ucsd.edu/ax22.html](https://www-hrx.ucsd.edu/ax22.html)), run script `convert_XBT_to_nc.py` on directory `proc/`.
